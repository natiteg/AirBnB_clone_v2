### Classes :cl:

AlxBnB supports the following classes:

* BaseModel
* User
* State
* City
* Amenity
* Place
* Review

## Storage :baggage_claim:

The above classes are handled by one of either two abstracted storage engines,
depending on the call - [FileStorage](./models/engine/file_storage.py) or
[DBStorage](./models/engine/db_storage.py).

### FileStorage

The default mode.

In `FileStorage` mode, every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB
instantiates an instance of `FileStorage` called `storage`. The `storage`
object is loaded/re-loaded from any class instances stored in the JSON file
`file.json`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the
`storage` object is used to register corresponding changes in the `file.json`.

### DBStorage

Run by setting the environmental variables `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db`.

In `DBStorage` mode, every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB
instantiates an instance of `DBStorage` called `storage`. The `storage` object
is loaded/re-loaded from the MySQL database specified in the environmental variable
`HBNB_MYSQL_DB`, using the user `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`, password `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`, and
host `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the
`storage` object is used to register changes in the corresponding MySQL database.
Connection and querying is achieved using SQLAlchemy.

Note that the databases specified for `DBStorage` to connect to must already be
defined on the MySQL server. This repository includes scripts
[setup_mysql_dev.sql](./setup_mysql_dev.sql) and [setup_mysql_test.sql](./setup_mysql_test.sql)
to set up `hbnb_dev_db` and `hbnb_test_db` databases in a MySQL server,
respectively.

## Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend
of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by
the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined above).
